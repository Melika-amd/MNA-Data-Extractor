<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Dear Akoyans,</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I hope this note finds all of you well and Happy New Year to each of
you.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We are kicking off 2025 with some exciting news. This morning, we announced
that we are combining forces with Quanterix Corporation in an all-stock transaction.&nbsp; Many of you are familiar with Quanterix, its
business and team based nearby in Billerica, MA.&nbsp; I would encourage you to read the enclosed press release from this morning.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Bringing Together Akoya and Quanterix</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Here at Akoya, we have established ourselves as scientific and market
leaders in spatial biology providing solutions that enable profound expansion of our knowledge of disease progression and response to
therapy using high resolution spatial phenotyping of tissue.&nbsp; Quanterix brings equal leadership and scientific expertise with advanced
tools for the ultra-sensitive detection of biomarkers in blood, serum and plasma. &nbsp;The combination of the two organizations and technology
platforms provides the first fully integrated technology ecosystem to identify and measure biomarkers across tissue and blood.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Our 1,300 instruments have enabled Akoya to be a significant force
in cancer biomarker discovery and translational research with rapidly emerging clinical partnerships helping us achieve our goal of improving
patient care.&nbsp; Similarly, Quanterix with 1,000 instruments in the market has an established leadership position in the neurology
market also with significant opportunities for expansive market success in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics, especially Alzheimer&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
By joining forces with Quanterix, we now have the opportunity to increase our commercial reach across the high growth markets in neurology,
oncology and immunology from discovery to diagnostics and from tissue to blood, a powerful combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This combination also creates a life sciences tools and emerging diagnostic
company at an impressive scale. We will have combined revenue of ~$220 million, a path to generating positive cash flow in 2026 with an
expected combined balance sheet of ~$175M in cash at the time of closing, likely the second quarter of this year. That is a robust and
solid financial profile.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Your hard work has made this milestone possible, and I hope you share
my excitement for this new chapter in Akoya&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; This is a true catalyst for us as Akoyans, our customers and our shareholders.</P>

second quarter of 2025, which will be followed by a thoughtful integration to bring our organizations together to realize our elevated
and combined vision.</P>

of the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended.&nbsp; Forward-looking statements are based on, among other things, projections as to the anticipated benefits of
the proposed transaction as well as statements regarding the impact of the proposed transaction on Quanterix&rsquo;s and Akoya&rsquo;s
business and future financial and operating results, the amount and timing of synergies from the proposed transaction and the closing
date for the proposed transaction. Words and phrases such as &ldquo;may,&rdquo; &ldquo;approximately,&rdquo; &ldquo;continue,&rdquo;

words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.&nbsp; Quanterix and Akoya caution readers that
forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict with regard to, among other things,
timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence, which could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.
Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the following possibilities: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances
that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the definitive merger agreement entered into between Quanterix
and Akoya; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Quanterix or Akoya; the failure to obtain necessary regulatory
approvals (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company
or the expected benefits of the proposed transaction) and stockholder approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed
transaction on a timely basis or at all; the possibility that the anticipated benefits and synergies of the proposed transaction are
not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies
or as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where Quanterix and Akoya do business; the possibility
that the proposed transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated; diversion of management&rsquo;s attention from ongoing
business operations and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those
resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; changes in Quanterix&rsquo;s share price before the closing
of the proposed transaction; risks relating to the potential dilutive effect of shares of Quanterix common stock to be issued in the
proposed transaction; and other factors that may affect future results of Quanterix, Akoya and the combined company.&nbsp; Additional
factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Quanterix&rsquo;s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended, Akoya&rsquo;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,
and in other documents Quanterix and Akoya file with the SEC, which are available on the SEC&rsquo;s website at <U>www.sec.gov</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Quanterix&rsquo;s or Akoya&rsquo;s underlying assumptions prove to
be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Quanterix and Akoya anticipate. Quanterix and Akoya caution readers not to
place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information
available at that time. Neither Quanterix nor Akoya assumes any obligation to update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements
