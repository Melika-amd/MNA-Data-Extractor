Delaware corporation (&#8220;Quanterix&#8221;) and Wellfleet Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Quanterix (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Akoya (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), with Akoya continuing as the surviving company
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Quanterix following the transaction.</P>

converted into equivalent awards with respect to shares of common stock of Quanterix, subject to the same vesting schedule and other terms
and conditions as existed prior to such conversion. The conversion of such equity awards (including, in the case of stock options, the
exercise price thereof) will be based on the Exchange Ratio. However, equity awards that, by their existing terms, provide for vesting
acceleration triggered in connection with the Merger will be so accelerated in accordance with such terms.</P>

into between Quanterix and Akoya; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Quanterix or Akoya; the failure
to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely
affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the Merger) and stockholder approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions
to the Merger on a timely basis or at all; the possibility that the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger are not realized
when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as
a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where Quanterix and Akoya do business; the possibility that
the Merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated; diversion of management&#8217;s attention from ongoing business operations
and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement
or completion of the Merger; changes in Quanterix&#8217;s share price before the closing of the Merger; risks relating to the potential
dilutive effect of shares of Quanterix common stock to be issued in the Merger; and other factors that may affect future results of Quanterix,
Akoya and the combined company.&#8239; Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can
be found in Quanterix&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended, Akoya&#8217;s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other documents Quanterix and Akoya file with the SEC, which are available on
the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov.&#8239;&#8239;&#160;</P>

discontinue access by any Person or group of Persons, and any of their Affiliates (other than the Company and its Affiliates), to any
data room (virtual or otherwise) established by Parent or its Representatives for such purpose. Within two (2) Business Days from the
date of this Agreement, Parent shall request the return or destruction of all confidential,&nbsp;non-public information provided to third
parties that have entered into confidentiality agreements with Parent or any Subsidiary thereof in connection with consideration of any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval,
Parent and the Parent Board may take any actions described in clause (ii)&nbsp;of this <U>Section&nbsp;6.04(d)</U> with respect to a third
party if (A) Parent receives a <I>bona fide</I> unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent from such third party

legal counsel) that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal with respect to Parent,
and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
the Parent Board under applicable Law; <U>provided</U> that Parent may deliver non-public information to such third party only pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (but in relation to Parent rather than the Company) so long as Parent (I) concurrently provides
to the Company any information and data concerning Parent or any Subsidiary or access provided to such third party that was not previously
made available to the Company, and (II) sends a copy of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to the Company promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) following its execution and delivery (and Parent shall not thereafter terminate, waive, amend, release
or modify any material provisions of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). Nothing contained in this <U>Section&nbsp;6.04</U> shall
prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from taking and disclosing to the Parent Stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to Parent pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure,
if the Parent Board has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Parent Stockholders under applicable Law,&nbsp;provided that this sentence shall
not permit the Parent Board to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, except to the extent permitted by <U>Section&nbsp;6.04(e)</U>
or <U>Section&nbsp;6.04(f)</U>. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions contained in this
<U>Section 6.04(d)</U> by any of Parent&rsquo;s or its Subsidiaries&rsquo; respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of
this <U>Section 6.04(d)</U> by Parent.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: justify; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Statements included in this communication which are not historical
in nature or do not relate to current facts are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, forward-looking statements for purposes
of the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.&nbsp; Forward-looking statements are based on, among other things, projections as to the anticipated benefits of the
proposed transaction as well as statements regarding the impact of the proposed transaction on Quanterix&rsquo;s and Akoya&rsquo;s business
and future financial and operating results, the amount and timing of synergies from the proposed transaction and the closing date for
the proposed transaction. Words and phrases such as &ldquo;may,&rdquo; &ldquo;approximately,&rdquo; &ldquo;continue,&rdquo; &ldquo;should,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;expects,&rdquo; &ldquo;projects,&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipates,&rdquo; &ldquo;is likely,&rdquo; &ldquo;look ahead,&rdquo; &ldquo;look

 &ldquo;could,&rdquo; &ldquo;potential,&rdquo; &ldquo;possible&rdquo; and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended
to identify such forward-looking statements.&nbsp; Quanterix and Akoya caution readers that forward-looking statements are subject to
certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict with regard to, among other things, timing, extent, likelihood and degree
of occurrence, which could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. Such risks and uncertainties include, among
others, the following possibilities: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one
or both of the parties to terminate the definitive merger agreement entered into between Quanterix and Akoya; the outcome of any legal
proceedings that may be instituted against Quanterix or Akoya; the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (and the risk that
such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of
the proposed transaction) and stockholder approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed transaction on a timely
basis or at all; the possibility that the anticipated benefits and synergies of the proposed transaction are not realized when expected
or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the
strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where Quanterix and Akoya do business; the possibility that the proposed
transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated; diversion of management&rsquo;s attention from ongoing business operations
and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement
or completion of the proposed transaction; changes in Quanterix&rsquo;s share price before the closing of the proposed transaction; risks
relating to the potential dilutive effect of shares of Quanterix common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction; and other factors
that may affect future results of Quanterix, Akoya and the combined company.&nbsp; Additional factors that could cause results to differ
materially from those described above can be found in Quanterix&rsquo;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,
as amended, Akoya&rsquo;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other documents Quanterix and Akoya
