    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thank you, Steven, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm [indiscernible] Shutterstock's CEO, Paul Hennessy&#894; and CFO, Rik Powell. We're excited to speak to what we believe to be a
      truly transformational merger that will result in a company with a strong financial foundation and opportunities for superior value creation for customers, creators and our combined shareholder base.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We're thrilled about the potential to partner with the Shutterstock team at a time when Getty Images has been building positive organic performance momentum, as evidenced by our third quarter
      results. And we're confident that together, we'll be able to carry that momentum forward with additional financial flexibility to grow in a dynamic digital content market.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We prepared a few slides about the transaction, which I'll walk through, and then open it up to your questions. But before doing so, I'd like to offer my thanks to Paul Hennessy for his partnership
      in making this happen and turn it over to him to share any thoughts on the transaction from his perspective.</div>

    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thanks so much, Craig, and thanks to the teams from both Shutterstock and Getty Images who have worked collaboratively and diligently to get us to this point.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At Shutterstock, our purpose is to empower the world to tell their stories by bridging the gap between idea and execution, and this merger only extends our ability to achieve this. Providing the
      best and most diverse content has been at the heart of Shutterstock's business since day 1.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition to this philosophy, we have also shown tremendous agility in evolving our offerings to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers, most recently through the strategic acquisition of
      the unlimited subscription-based and stock content business and our ongoing investments in our rapidly growing data, distribution and services business. This merger unlocks many opportunities for the Shutterstock contributors and customers through
      expanded distribution channels and increased availability of new and exclusive content and creates immediate value for shareholders of both companies.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We're excited at the prospect of what the combination of these 2 great companies can achieve in a world where content is more widely consumed than ever before.</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> <br>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With that, I'll hand back to Craig.</div>

      <div style="page-break-after: always;" class="BRPFPageBreak">
        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thanks, Paul. That's a nice segue to pick up on Slide 6 of the presentation and address the major question on all your minds. Why come together now? As a combined business, simply put, we believe
      we can offer our media, corporate and agency customers of all sizes and across all regions a comprehensive suite of solutions to meet any of their visual content needs.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Given the rapidly evolving landscape, as a combined company, we have far greater resources to continue to innovate for our customers. This transaction will immediately increase our financial
      flexibility. Getty Images has consistently focused on the importance of deleveraging our balance sheet. We made some great strides over the past several years on this front, and the transaction will deliver our stated goal of leverage below 3x EBITDA
      and enhance our liquidity to continue to delever, evaluate returns to shareholders and invest in opportunities.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The transaction is expected to be highly accretive to the company's earnings and cash flow. We're forecasting between $150 million and $200 million in cost synergies by year 3, with just under 2/3
      expected to be delivered within the first 12 to 24 months.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In short, for shareholders of both companies, we expect to unlock significant value to reduce leverage levels, cost synergies, operational efficiencies and the pursuit of new revenue opportunities.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Taking a step back and looking at Slide 7, I'd like to run through some of the transaction details, and there are a few key points we'd like you to take away from this slide. First, this is a mixed
      offering where Shutterstock shareholders will have the opportunity to receive cash value at close and participate in the equity upside we expect to generate as a combined company.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Each Shutterstock shareholder can elect to receive either cash, stock or a combination of cash and stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of $331 million in cash, with no more than 319.4 million
      shares of Getty Images stock and subject to proration. Following the close, existing Getty Images shareholders will own approximately 54.7% of the combined company and Shutterstock shareholders will own approximately 45.3%.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I will continue leading the combined company as CEO and Mark Getty will remain as Chairman of our 11- member Board, which will include 4 Directors appointed by Shutterstock, including Paul
      Hennessy.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While it would take some time to obtain the customary regulatory and shareholder approvals, we are hopeful the transaction will close sometime in the second half of 2025.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moving to Slide 8. Strategically, this merger is a great fit for a number of reasons. Focusing on the top 3. One, both companies bring highly complementary strengths to the table. By matching Getty
      Images premier exclusive content with Shutterstock's strong brands and leadership in categories such as 3D, Music and GIPHY, we expect to go to market with a more extensive and diverse set of solutions for customers.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Second, both companies understand the importance of investing for growth. And together, we have greater capacity for sustained investment. The combined business will aim to invest in continued
      innovation, expanding content and coverage and in technologies, inclusive of AI, which I'll touch on in more detail momentarily.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">And third and final, we're looking forward to being able to offer content creators who sit at the very heart of what we do expanded reach. Our contributors want and need to get their visuals in
      front of the right audience, and now they'll have many more opportunities to do so.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The combined business will have more than 1.4 million annual subscribers, will serve small and medium-sized businesses in addition to large enterprises with a presence in more than 200 countries.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moving to Slide 9. I already touched on the estimated annual cost synergies of between $150 million and $200 million we believe we have the potential to achieve. But to give you more color, the
      vast majority of these savings, nearly 90% will be in SG&amp;A within the remainder coming in CapEx. Both Getty Images and Shutterstock have a long track record of integrating businesses and realizing synergies, and we are confident we can deliver
      these.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With that said, while we unify our technology platform as part of delivering those synergies, I also want to be very clear that we fully expect Shutterstock to continue as a brand and a website
      based on the incredible brand equity built by John, Paul and the team.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moving to Slide 10. Paul and I firmly believe AI represents significant opportunities. We've been investing in it. And through the merger, we are better poised to capitalize on them. Getty Images
      continues to see customer adoption grow for our custom fine-tuned, commercially safe generative AI model, and Shutterstock is also starting to see positive traction with its Generative AI Plus offering.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We know customers want to leverage AI as part of their creative process and offering. AI services alongside our combined pre shot and custom solutions will be an incredibly powerful offering.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Given the strategic and financial benefits I spoke to earlier, we are well positioned to continue investing in AI capabilities and distributing those capabilities across a combined customer base.
      And we're going to continue to do so in a responsible way that ensures human creativity continues to flourish, fair use rights are respected and creators are appropriately rewarded for their immense contributions.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moving to Slide 11. We can double-click on our pro forma financials, and you can see the value creation we're expecting to achieve here. On a pro forma basis, the combined business approaches $2
      billion in annual revenue with nearly half of that from annual subscriptions.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At Getty Images, we've been on a journey over the past few years to shift our revenue model towards subscriptions, and it's working. In the third quarter of 2024, we announced our ninth consecutive
      quarter with annual subscriber growth of approximately 50% or more on an LTM basis.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Subscribers are increasingly drawn to our unique and differentiated content, and we expect this combination to only deepen our customer commitment to our product.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="clear: both; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" class="BRPFPageBreakArea">
      <div style="page-break-after: always;" class="BRPFPageBreak">
        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Our combined pro forma adjusted EBITDA is expected to be just over $570 million in 2024, at the midpoint of our respective guidance rates. That translates to a roughly 29% margin. And more
      importantly, these figures do not include any of the estimated $175 million midpoint of our annual run rate cost synergies, and we expect to achieve, again, at the midpoint of that range.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Once you factor in those synergies, our adjusted EBITDA increases to $727 million, which translates to an expanded incredibly strong margin of approximately 37%. Unlevered pretax free cash flow or
      EBITDA less CapEx is a similar story, where even before accounting for synergies, we expect to approximately $464 million in 2024.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Slide 12. As I mentioned earlier, one of the key benefits of this transaction is that it facilitates immediate deleveraging. It will put us squarely within our stated target of net leverage between
      2.5 and 3x EBITDA. On a standalone basis, as of September 30, 2024, we were just over 4x leverage.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Upon closing, we expect to reach below -- marks below 3x on a combined pro forma basis. And again, when considering synergies and liquidity expansion, we are confident we can continue to delever
      this business further.</div>
    <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a combined business with stronger balance sheet and cash flows, we expect to have much greater capital allocation flexibility. We'd be able to further expedite debt repayment to reduce our
      borrowing costs, have greater capacity to invest in growth initiatives and, of course, remain opportunistic in exploring other ways we can potentially create value for shareholders.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;">Thanks, Bernie. I'll take this and then can -- Paul can add in over the top. On the data licensing side of things, both companies have done some level of data licensing. We expect that, that will continue post close.
        But I wouldn't read into it any top line synergies on that basis. Again, we're really -- from a transactional standpoint, this is really more about the operational and cost synergies.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">On the gen AI front, both Paul and I have talked to this in prior calls. Our businesses have not seen any impact as a result of gen AI. We think our pre shot offering and our custom offerings stand on the merits of

        what was kind of logic of that 28-84 share offer for stock at close on September 30? And then second, can you talk about the regulatory approval process in the U.S. and Europe as well and just the level of confidence that the deal will go through?</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">Thanks, Youssef. Appreciate the sign of confidence in -- on the transaction. With respect to the valuation, look, it's one that obviously is highly negotiated. And -- but we believe that we arrived at a fair place
        based off the respective equity valuations and enterprise valuations of these businesses on a 30-, 60-, 90-day VWAP. And so we believe it's a fair deal, that is fair to both sides in terms of shareholders and stakeholders. So that's really how we
        wound up where we wound up.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">With respect to the regulatory front, clearly, we have processes that we go through. But this is -- we are in a large visual content market. Customers have so many opportunities to produce their own content or to
        source that content freely across a wide variety of services. And certainly, AI now being one of those.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">So we're pretty confident that, ultimately, this transaction will get approval. Again, we don't control the exact timing of that, but we have a high confidence. This has never been a situation where customers have
        not had choice. They've always had choice.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">We believe we're an excellent choice, and we'd like to be their choice more often than not. But there are a lot of options for customers in the market, and that's only expanding. So appreciate the question and the

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">Thanks, Cory. So let me -- on the cross-seeling, one of the things that the Shutterstock team has done is they've built really a great combination of assets across a variety of asset types. So whether that's GIPHY or
        whether that's 3D assets through TurboSquid or whether that's Music through PremiumBeat, those are things that Getty Images has not brought to the table historically.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">And so we do see opportunities to bring those to market across an expanded customer base. So certainly, we do see those types of opportunities. It's going to take us a bit to get there. And we're really pleased that
        Envato was now part of the Shutterstock portfolio. They fit very well with our subscription strategy, and they bring a wide range of asset to the table.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;">Craig, I think you answered it well. In an e-commerce world, we've got a diverse set of customers that are looking for unique and specific things. And when you combine the assets of the 2 companies, conversion goes
        north. So this is just a great opportunity for our -- both our customers and our contributors. And I think that just naturally leads to revenue opportunities.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;">The companies have been investing in that. But clearly, we can reduce the duplication of investment, and that's going to allow us to accelerate delivery of what we've already collectively been investing in.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">Both companies again are making significant investments in surge, in delivery, in whole variety of items, but what we're going to be able to do is do that with a combined resource base. And so it's really
        acceleration.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">Now we'll also have opportunities to look at M&amp;A. It's not that the companies haven't been looking at opportunities. And clearly, the Shutterstock team has been more active than not. And we've been more focused

      <div style="text-align: justify;">Editorial was a strength of the Getty platform. Can you guys just talk about the opportunity in terms of combining that asset with Shutterstock and what you guys can do and bring with greater scale there?</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">And then secondly, capital allocation is significantly different between the 2 companies, right? Shutterstock has been returning capital with the dividend. How do we think about that aspect as Getty does delever? And
        how do you guys think about capital allocation as the balance sheet moves towards something that's more neutral?</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">Thank you, Andrew. I think I've got your question. So look, we are incredibly proud of our editorial business at Getty Images. It is an amazing business. It's amazing assets. It represents an amazing archive.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">There are going to be opportunities that present themselves around how we can leverage that capability across the Shutterstock customer base and platform. But ultimately, to say it's just -- it continues to be a very
        important part of our overall business and a very important part of why customers choose Getty Images. And we deliver a lot of value back to our customers through that service.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">With respect to capital allocation, I think it's a bit early. But clearly, this gives us opportunities to evaluate potential, whether that's stock buyback or dividends, as we continue to delever. So those will be
        things that we'll be able to make those decisions as we close and move forward.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">Thanks, Tim. I've said this from -- in many, many conversations and on -- in many times. These businesses are much more complementary than people ever think or give credit to.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">We at Getty Images have a very different business and a very different composition. It's a business that's built on exclusive content. It's a business that is oriented through our primary brand and Getty Images
        towards the enterprise.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">And the Shutterstock businesses have a broader reach across small and midsized businesses, a different geographic reach as we referenced in some of our calls prior.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">So these are highly complementary businesses. We don't go into most of our sales engagements and find that we've got Shutterstock on the competitive side or vice versa. This is -- these are very complementary assets.
        And I expect that we'll be able to leverage that complementary nature in order to drive through new revenue opportunities.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;">Yes, I'd echo that. It's complementary on people. It's complementary on distribution channels. It's complementary on asset types. It's complementary on platform types. I think there's real opportunities for revenue
        growth because the businesses are different.</div>

        the power of our pre shot libraries and our asset capabilities. And I think that will just continue going forward.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">But again, we'll be able to reduce the duplication of that effort, and so we're excited for that. And we should see acceleration in terms of delivery as a result of that.</div>

        other matters. All statements, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements.&#160; Forward-looking statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations or financial condition,
        financings or otherwise, based on current beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.&#160; Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made or as of the
        dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as there can be no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur or the timing thereof.&#160;
        Forward-looking statements can often, but not always, be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology including &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;pro forma,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221;
        &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;designed,&#8221; or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology, but not all forward-looking statements include such identifying words.&#160; Forward-looking statements are
        based upon current plans, estimates and expectations that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.&#160; Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
        vary.&#160; The forward-looking statements in this communication relate to, among other things, obtaining applicable regulatory and stockholder approvals on a timely basis or otherwise, satisfying other closing conditions to the proposed transaction, on
        a timely basis or otherwise, the expected tax treatment of the transaction, the expected timing of the transaction, and the integration of the businesses and the expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and growth to result therefrom.&#160;
        Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, among other things: failure to obtain applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; interloper
        risk; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the transaction or to complete the transaction on anticipated terms and timing (or at all); negative effects of the announcement of the transaction on the ability of Shutterstock or Getty Images
        to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and others who Shutterstock or Getty Images does business, or on Shutterstock or Getty Images&#8217; operating results and business generally; risks that the businesses
        will not be integrated successfully or that the combined company will not realize expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and/or growth, as expected (or at all), or that such benefits may take longer to realize or may be more costly
        to achieve than expected; the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm business plans and operations; risks relating to unanticipated costs of integration; significant transaction and/or integration costs, or difficulties in connection
        with the transaction and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities; restrictions during the pendency of the transaction that may impact the ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; potential litigation associated with
        the transaction; the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the transaction on Getty Images&#8217;, Shutterstock&#8217;s or the combined company&#8217;s relationships with suppliers, customers, employers and regulators; demand for the combined
        company&#8217;s products; potential changes in the Getty Images stock price that could negatively impact the value of the consideration offered to the Shutterstock stockholders; the occurrence of any event that could give rise to the termination of the
        proposed transaction; and Getty Images&#8217; ability to complete any refinancing of its debt or new debt financing on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all.&#160; A more fulsome discussion of the risks related to the proposed transaction will be
        included in the proxy and information statement/prospectus.&#160; For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements, see the section captioned &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in each of
        Getty Images&#8217; and Shutterstock&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.&#160; Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or
        should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward looking statements.&#160; While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the proxy
        and information statement/prospectus will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.&#160; Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the
        realization of forward looking statements.&#160; Neither Getty Images nor Shutterstock assumes, and each hereby disclaims, any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.</div>
