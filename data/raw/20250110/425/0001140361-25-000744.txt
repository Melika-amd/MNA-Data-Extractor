    <div style="text-align: center; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">FAQ for Current and Future Candidates, New Joiners and Hiring Managers - </div>
    <div style="text-align: center; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Regarding Shutterstock's Impending Acquisition by Getty</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Is the acquisition of Shutterstock by Getty going to affect my job offer or the hiring process?</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">A:</font> No. As planned, we are still committed to hiring for critical roles, and we are not rescinding any offers. Your job offer remains valid, and we are excited for you to join us as planned. The hiring
      process is continuing as usual, and we are actively recruiting for critical positions.&#160; Until the acquisition closes, your offer and the hiring process will continue solely with Shutterstock (and remain separate from Getty).</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Should I be concerned about the future of my role after the merger?</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">A:</font> We cannot predict the future, however, what we do know is that this role is critical to our success. The transaction aims to combine the strengths of both companies, creating new opportunities for growth,
      innovation, and career development. While it is business as usual until the closing, our focus is on building a stronger, more competitive organization that offers exciting prospects for all employees. </div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Q: How long will it take to close the deal? What will happen during that time?</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">A:</font>&#160;We hope the transaction will close in the second half of 2025.&#160;Until we close the transaction, Shutterstock and Getty remain independent companies and it is business as usual, and that includes employees
      of each company remaining with their respective organization until closing. Shutterstock will continue to focus on their 2025 strategy and priorities.</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Q: How will this acquisition impact my career development opportunities?</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">A: </font>We cannot predict the future, however, the transaction aims to combine the strengths of both companies, creating new opportunities for growth, innovation, and career development. While it is business as
      usual until the closing, our focus is on building a stronger, more competitive organization that offers exciting prospects for all employees. </div>

    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Will there be any immediate changes to my benefits, salary, or role once the acquisition is finalized?</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">A: </font>We expect no change to our current programs or benefits through the pre-closing period. We will continue to have our annual performance and compensation cycle as planned. As always, Shutterstock reserves
      the right to make changes as needed in the ordinary course.</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div>Once the deal closes, per the terms of the merger agreement, employees who continue their employment with the combined company will maintain their base salary and substantially equivalent incentive opportunities and benefits for at least 1 year
      post close.&#160; More information will be shared as we get closer to the expected transaction closing.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>In the event your role is eliminated within 1 year after the close, we have ensured that you will still be eligible for severance under the Shutterstock severance plan. </div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Will I receive updates about the acquisition and its impact on the company?</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">A: </font>Yes. We are committed to transparent and open communication throughout this process. As more information becomes available, we will keep you updated in a timely manner.</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Q: What is the overall goal of the merger between Shutterstock and Getty?</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">A:</font>&#160;To create a premier visual content company. As a combined company, Getty Images and Shutterstock will offer a content library with greater depth and breadth for the benefit of customers, expand
      opportunities for its contributor community and reinforce its commitment to the adoption of inclusive and representative content. Furthermore, the stronger financial profile of the combined company will create increased capacity for investment and
      innovation for customers in a fast-evolving and highly competitive environment.</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Is there anything I should do differently or prepare for during this transition?</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">A:</font> At this stage, there&#8217;s nothing you need to do differently. We encourage you to continue with the same focus and excitement as you prepare to join us at Shutterstock. We will communicate any next steps if
      needed, and rest assured, we are here to support you during this process.</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Q: What can I expect from Shutterstock in terms of ongoing support during the merger process?</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">A:</font> You can expect clear, consistent communication, as well as support from both leadership and People teams. We are committed to helping you through any changes that may occur and ensuring that your
      experience at Shutterstock remains positive and aligned with our future goals.</div>

    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">Forward-Looking Statements</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: #212529;">The statements in this communication, and any related oral statements, include forward-looking statements concerning Getty Images, Shutterstock, the proposed transaction described herein and other
      matters. All statements, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements.&#160; Forward-looking statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations or financial condition,
      financings or otherwise, based on current beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.&#160; Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made or as of the
      dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as there can be no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur or the timing thereof.&#160;
      Forward-looking statements can often, but not always, be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology including &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;pro forma,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221;
      &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;designed,&#8221; or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology, but not all forward-looking statements include such identifying words.&#160; Forward-looking statements are based
      upon current plans, estimates and expectations that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.&#160; Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary.&#160; The
      forward-looking statements in this communication relate to, among other things, obtaining applicable regulatory and stockholder approvals on a timely basis or otherwise, satisfying other closing conditions to the proposed transaction, on a timely
      basis or otherwise, the expected tax treatment of the transaction, the expected timing of the transaction, and the integration of the businesses and the expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and growth to result therefrom.&#160; Important
      factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, among other things: failure to obtain applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; interloper risk; failure
      to satisfy other closing conditions to the transaction or to complete the transaction on anticipated terms and timing (or at all); negative effects of the announcement of the transaction on the ability of Shutterstock or Getty Images to retain and
      hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and others who Shutterstock or Getty Images does business, or on Shutterstock or Getty Images&#8217; operating results and business generally; risks that the businesses will not be
      integrated successfully or that the combined company will not realize expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and/or growth, as expected (or at all), or that such benefits may take longer to realize or may be more costly to achieve than
      expected; the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm business plans and operations; risks relating to unanticipated costs of integration; significant transaction and/or integration costs, or difficulties in connection with the
      transaction and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities; restrictions during the pendency of the transaction that may impact the ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; potential litigation associated with the
      transaction; the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the transaction on Getty Images&#8217;, Shutterstock&#8217;s or the combined company&#8217;s relationships with suppliers, customers, employers and regulators; demand for the combined company&#8217;s
      products; potential changes in the Getty Images stock price that could negatively impact the value of the consideration offered to the Shutterstock stockholders; the occurrence of any event that could give rise to the termination of the proposed
      transaction; and Getty Images&#8217; ability to complete any refinancing of its debt or new debt financing on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all.&#160; A more fulsome discussion of the risks related to the proposed transaction will be included in the
      proxy and information statement/prospectus.&#160; For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements, see the section captioned &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in each of Getty Images&#8217; and
      Shutterstock&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.&#160; Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
      assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward looking statements.&#160; While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the proxy and information
      statement/prospectus will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.&#160; Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of
      forward looking statements.&#160; Neither Getty Images nor Shutterstock assumes, and each hereby disclaims, any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.</div>
