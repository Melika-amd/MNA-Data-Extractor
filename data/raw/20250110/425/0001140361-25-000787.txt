      <div>To our Customers,</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>As we start the New Year, we&#8217;re excited to share some news with you: Shutterstock and Getty Images have announced plans to merge. This news impacts Shutterstock and its family of brands including TurboSquid, Pond5, PremiumBeat, GIPHY and Envato.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Once the transaction is closed, we expect this merger to increase our ability to invest in new content, live coverage, technologies and capabilities, services, and support to meet the ever-changing needs of our large and small customers
        worldwide. We also expect to provide our customers with simplified access to a larger range of diverse, high-quality, ethically-sourced licensable content to fuel their storytelling and the impact of their work.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>While we expect the merger to take some time to finalize, we wanted to keep you updated on the big news and reinforce that your current Shutterstock services and solutions will continue without interruption. For now, Shutterstock and Getty
        Images remain independent companies and it&#8217;s business as usual until closing. We are committed to keeping you informed as things progress and will continue to deliver the quality, value, and partnership you already know and expect from
        Shutterstock. If you have any questions, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to your direct contact at Shutterstock or our support team.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Thank you for the continued trust and support. We are excited about the opportunities this merger brings to help you succeed and look forward to embarking on this next chapter together.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">Forward-Looking Statements</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">The statements in this communication, and any related oral statements, include forward-looking statements concerning Getty Images, Shutterstock, the proposed transaction described herein and
        other matters. All statements, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements.&#160; Forward-looking statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations or financial condition,
        financings or otherwise, based on current beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.&#160; Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made or as of the
        dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as there can be no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur or the timing thereof.&#160;
        Forward-looking statements can often, but not always, be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology including &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;pro forma,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221;
        &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;designed,&#8221; or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology, but not all forward-looking statements include such identifying words.&#160; Forward-looking statements are
        based upon current plans, estimates and expectations that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.&#160; Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
        vary.&#160; The forward-looking statements in this communication relate to, among other things, obtaining applicable regulatory and stockholder approvals on a timely basis or otherwise, satisfying other closing conditions to the proposed transaction, on
        a timely basis or otherwise, the expected tax treatment of the transaction, the expected timing of the transaction, and the integration of the businesses and the expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and growth to result therefrom.&#160;
        Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, among other things: failure to obtain applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; interloper
        risk; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the transaction or to complete the transaction on anticipated terms and timing (or at all); negative effects of the announcement of the transaction on the ability of Shutterstock or Getty Images
        to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and others who Shutterstock or Getty Images does business, or on Shutterstock or Getty Images&#8217; operating results and business generally; risks that the businesses
        will not be integrated successfully or that the combined company will not realize expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and/or growth, as expected (or at all), or that such benefits may take longer to realize or may be more costly
        to achieve than expected; the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm business plans and operations; risks relating to unanticipated costs of integration; significant transaction and/or integration costs, or difficulties in connection
        with the transaction and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities; restrictions during the pendency of the transaction that may impact the ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; potential litigation associated with
        the transaction; the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the transaction on Getty Images&#8217;, Shutterstock&#8217;s or the combined company&#8217;s relationships with suppliers, customers, employers and regulators; demand for the combined
        company&#8217;s products; potential changes in the Getty Images stock price that could negatively impact the value of the consideration offered to the Shutterstock stockholders; the occurrence of any event that could give rise to the termination of the
        proposed transaction; and Getty Images&#8217; ability to complete any refinancing of its debt or new debt financing on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all.&#160; A more fulsome discussion of the risks related to the proposed transaction will be
        included in the proxy and information statement/prospectus.&#160; For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements, see the section captioned &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in each of
        Getty Images&#8217; and Shutterstock&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.&#160; Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or
        should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward looking statements.&#160; While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the proxy
        and information statement/prospectus will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.&#160; Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the
        realization of forward looking statements.&#160; Neither Getty Images nor Shutterstock assumes, and each hereby disclaims, any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.</div>
