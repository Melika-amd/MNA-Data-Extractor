    <div style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT HAPPENED, WHY &amp; WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT:</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">What was announced today?</div>
    <div>Shutterstock and Getty Images announced that they entered into an agreement to merge, creating a premier visual content company. As a combined company, Getty Images and Shutterstock will offer a content library with greater depth and breadth for
      the benefit of customers, expand opportunities for its contributor community and reinforce its commitment to the adoption of inclusive &amp; representative content. Furthermore, the stronger financial profile of the combined company will create
      increased capacity for investment and innovation for customers in a fast-evolving and highly competitive environment.&#160; Until we close the transaction, Shutterstock and Getty remain independent companies and it is business as usual.</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">What are the strategic benefits of merging? </div>
    <div>This merger is transformational for both companies. Combining these businesses unlocks new opportunities, such as: </div>
    <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 36pt;">&#9679;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Complementary portfolios to address diverse customer needs</div>
    <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 36pt;">&#9679;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Additional opportunities to invest for growth</div>
    <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 72pt;">&#9675;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Innovative content creation</div>
    <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 72pt;">&#9675;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Expanded event coverage</div>
    <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 72pt;">&#9675;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Customer-facing technologies and capabilities such as search, 3D imagery and generative AI</div>
    <div style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 36pt;">&#9679;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Expands opportunities for contributors to reach customers around the world </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">What role will Shutterstock&#8217;s management team have in the combined company?</div>
    <div>Until we close the transaction, Paul will continue to serve as CEO of Shutterstock, and he and the rest of the leadership team will maintain their focus on the Company&#8217;s strategic priorities. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>After closing, Craig Peters, CEO of Getty Images will be the CEO of the newly combined company (called Getty Images). Paul will become a board member of Getty Images and will no longer be CEO of Shutterstock. The specifics of the future
      organization are not yet finalized. Our leadership team is focused and motivated to lead their teams through this merger and provide support throughout the change process.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div class="BRPFPageBreakArea" style="clear: both; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;">
      <div class="BRPFPageBreak" style="page-break-after: always;">
        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">How does this impact our strategy/plans for 2025? </div>
    <div>Until the transaction closes, it is business as usual, and we will continue to focus on our 2025 strategy and priorities. As the process progresses, and as a normal course of business, we will evaluate our priorities regularly and adjust as needed
      to ensure we are growing our business and delivering for our customers as planned.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">How will this transaction impact my day-to-day responsibilities? </div>
    <div>For now, and until the transaction is closed, your work will be entirely led by your Shutterstock team and you should continue to drive for success in 2025 as planned. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">THE PROCESS:</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Is there a difference between &#8220;signing&#8221; and &#8220;closing&#8221;? What should we expect between signing and closing? </div>
    <div>We have <font style="font-weight: bold;">signed</font> an agreement to merge, but there are additional steps remaining before we <font style="font-weight: bold;">close</font> the merger transaction. Before Shutterstock and Getty actually merge,
      there are a number of closing conditions to satisfy, including shareholder approvals, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.&#160; In the period between signing and closing, it will remain business as usual and both companies will
      continue to operate independently.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">How long is the period between signing and closing?</div>
    <div>We anticipate the transaction will close in the second half of 2025.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Is it possible that this deal doesn&#8217;t close?</div>
    <div>It is always possible that an announced transaction won&#8217;t close. However, our expectation is that the transaction will close once all customary conditions to closing have been met, which is targeted in the second half of 2025. It is important that
      we continue to focus on Shutterstock&#8217;s 2025 strategy until we have closed. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT THIS MEANS FOR EMPLOYEES:</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Will anything change about my role or reporting structure?</div>
    <div>Until the transaction closes, there are no changes planned in your role or reporting structure. As always, Shutterstock reserves the right to make organizational changes as needed in order to achieve Shutterstock&#8217;s 2025 strategy during the
      pre-close period. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Will there be layoffs as a result of this transaction? </div>
    <div>At this time, we cannot provide specific details about potential changes to staffing. However, the transaction aims to combine the strengths of both companies, creating new opportunities for growth, innovation, and career development. While it is
      business as usual until the closing, our focus is on building a stronger, more competitive organization that offers exciting prospects for all employees. We will continue to communicate openly and provide updates as more information becomes
      available.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div class="BRPFPageBreakArea" style="clear: both; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;">
      <div class="BRPFPageBreak" style="page-break-after: always;">
        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>
    </div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">Will this affect my pay or benefits, including equity vesting and vacation? Will my compensation / benefits change when the deal closes?</font>&#160;</div>
    <div>We expect no change to our current programs or benefits through the pre-closing period. We will continue to have our annual performance and compensation cycle as planned. As always, Shutterstock reserves the right to make changes as needed in the
      ordinary course.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>Once the deal closes, per the terms of the merger agreement, employees who continue their employment with the combined company will maintain their base salary and substantially equivalent incentive opportunities and benefits for at least 1 year
      post close.&#160; More information will be shared as we get closer to the expected transaction closing.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">What will happen to my outstanding equity awards? Will they be converted to Getty Images shares? </div>
    <div>Current awards will be replaced under Getty&#8217;s equity plan at close.&#160; Under the signed agreement, underlying Shutterstock RSUs will convert to a mixture of unvested cash and equity in the same ratio as the &#8220;Mixed Election Shares&#8221; option offered to
      common shareholders covered in the agreement. The replacement awards will continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Shutterstock awards, including vesting dates, in place today.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="z_headingh.3znysh7"></a>If my position is eliminated, will severance pay be offered?</div>
    <div>In the event your role is eliminated, we have ensured that the Shutterstock severance plan will be honored for at least one year after the close date. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">How will this announcement impact promotions? Will promotions / salary increases still be given while the deal is in process? </div>
    <div>This news will not affect promotions or planned salary increases during the pre-close period. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Will there be changes to company processes and procedures?</div>
    <div>From now until the transaction closes, there will be no change to our policies and procedures as a result of or related to the potential merger. As soon as we know of any changes post close, we will update you.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">How will this impact remote work policies while we move towards close? Is Getty Images flexible about working from home or remote working? </div>
    <div>Until the transaction closes, it remains business as usual and Shutterstock will remain a flexible working environment. We do know that Getty currently operates similar to Shutterstock in regards to remote working - they have and encourage an in
      office presence but it is not mandated. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Will I need to relocate before the deal is closed? What about after the deal is closed? </div>
    <div>Until the transaction closes, it remains business as usual with no relocations planned. Discussions on the specifics of the future organization are ongoing and we will provide updates as they become available. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="z_headingh.2et92p0"></a>Can I apply to roles at Getty Images? </div>
    <div>Until the deal closes, anyone applying to Getty Images would be considered an external candidate.. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">How will I receive updates on the merger?</div>
    <div>You can expect that as we move through the process, we will communicate as soon as new information is confirmed. There may be periods where there isn&#8217;t a lot of new information, but multiple channels will be available for you to raise questions
      (All Hands meetings, Slack channel, leadership, etc.) and we will provide answers as quickly as the process allows. We will also establish an area on the Lens where you can get the latest updates.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div class="BRPFPageBreakArea" style="clear: both; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;">
      <div class="BRPFPageBreak" style="page-break-after: always;">
        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Can I post on social media?</div>
    <div>The Security and Exchange Commission has strict rules around employees communicating about a potential merger. You should not discuss or respond to discussions on social media regarding the merger in any manner. You may like or repost official
      company postings.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">How should I handle media inquiries about the merger? </div>
    <div>If you receive any media inquiries, please do not respond and forward to our Head of External Communications, Lori Rodney at <u>lrodney@shutterstock.com</u>.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">INTEGRATION:</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">When will integration efforts begin? </div>
    <div>We will not be integrating the companies until close. During the pre-close period, we will operate independently and it is business as usual unless you hear otherwise. Discussions about the future organization and planning will be happening with a
      limited number of people from both companies as we progress toward the close of the transaction. We will keep you updated with any new information as it becomes available. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">What are the combined company&#8217;s strategic priorities and in what areas will it focus its investments?</font>&#160;</div>
    <div>Discussions on the specifics of the future organization are ongoing and we will provide updates as they become available. Until the transaction closes, both companies will operate independently. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Will this merger increase Shutterstock&#8217;s ability to create new products and focus on innovation? </div>
    <div>Yes. One of the benefits of the merger of our complementary companies is an increased capacity to invest in growth and innovation, including investment in innovative content creation, expanded event coverage, and customer-facing technologies and
      capabilities such as search, 3D imagery and generative AI.&#160; &#160;</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">What if I am working on a project that is future focused and has implications to our business post close?</div>
    <div>Our plan is to continue to focus on our current 2025 strategy. If this changes, we will communicate it immediately. Please have discussions with your leaders if you have questions or concerns about what you are working on, otherwise, it is
      business as usual and you should continue to focus on your 2025 goals as planned.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Before the deal closes, can we interact with Getty teams?</div>
    <div>We should not be working with Getty teams on anything related to this deal. A limited number of people will be involved in discussion around planning for the integration following transaction close. Until then, Shutterstock and Getty Images will
      continue to operate as independent companies. If you currently have interactions with Getty as part of your Shutterstock role, please continue as you have been.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div class="BRPFPageBreakArea" style="clear: both; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;">
      <div class="BRPFPageBreak" style="page-break-after: always;">
        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Will the Shutterstock brand remain?</div>
    <div>What we do know from Getty is that they expect Shutterstock to continue as a brand and website based on its incredible brand equity built by Jon Oringer and our talented team. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Are we still planning the brand refresh?</div>
    <div>Yes. Our current plan is to continue to focus on our 2025 strategy and priorities as we have planned. We commit to communicate timely on any changes or updates to our 2025 strategy.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">What&#8217;s going to happen to GIPHY and Envato? Will we continue with existing integration plans?</div>
    <div>Yes, we will continue to progress on our current 2025 plans with GIPHY and Envato.</div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div><font style="font-weight: bold;">Before the deal closes, will Shutterstock be able to use Getty Images resources to support its goals?</font>&#160;</div>
    <div>No. Both companies will continue to operate independently until the transaction closes. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Does this mean Getty Images has to approve all business decisions at Shutterstock? </div>
    <div>Until the transaction closes, both companies will continue to operate independently. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">What role will Shutterstock&#8217;s board of directors have in the combined company?</div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold;">CUSTOMERS, CONTRIBUTORS &amp; PARTNERSHIPS: </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">What does this mean for our customers? </div>

      depth and breadth and an increased capacity for product investment and innovation.</div>

    <div style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">Forward-Looking Statements</div>
    <div>&#160;</div>
    <div style="text-align: justify; color: #212529;">The statements in this communication, and any related oral statements, include forward-looking statements concerning Getty Images, Shutterstock, the proposed transaction described herein and other
      matters. All statements, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements.&#160; Forward-looking statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations or financial condition,
      financings or otherwise, based on current beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.&#160; Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made or as of the
      dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as there can be no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur or the timing thereof.&#160;
      Forward-looking statements can often, but not always, be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology including &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;pro forma,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221;
      &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;designed,&#8221; or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology, but not all forward-looking statements include such identifying words.&#160; Forward-looking statements are based
      upon current plans, estimates and expectations that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.&#160; Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary.&#160; The
      forward-looking statements in this communication relate to, among other things, obtaining applicable regulatory and stockholder approvals on a timely basis or otherwise, satisfying other closing conditions to the proposed transaction, on a timely
      basis or otherwise, the expected tax treatment of the transaction, the expected timing of the transaction, and the integration of the businesses and the expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and growth to result therefrom.&#160; Important
      factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, among other things: failure to obtain applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; interloper risk; failure
      to satisfy other closing conditions to the transaction or to complete the transaction on anticipated terms and timing (or at all); negative effects of the announcement of the transaction on the ability of Shutterstock or Getty Images to retain and
      hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and others who Shutterstock or Getty Images does business, or on Shutterstock or Getty Images&#8217; operating results and business generally; risks that the businesses will not be
      integrated successfully or that the combined company will not realize expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and/or growth, as expected (or at all), or that such benefits may take longer to realize or may be more costly to achieve than
      expected; the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm business plans and operations; risks relating to unanticipated costs of integration; significant transaction and/or integration costs, or difficulties in connection with the
      transaction and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities; restrictions during the pendency of the transaction that may impact the ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; potential litigation associated with the
      transaction; the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the transaction on Getty Images&#8217;, Shutterstock&#8217;s or the combined company&#8217;s relationships with suppliers, customers, employers and regulators; demand for the combined company&#8217;s
      products; potential changes in the Getty Images stock price that could negatively impact the value of the consideration offered to the Shutterstock stockholders; the occurrence of any event that could give rise to the termination of the proposed
      transaction; and Getty Images&#8217; ability to complete any refinancing of its debt or new debt financing on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all.&#160; A more fulsome discussion of the risks related to the proposed transaction will be included in the
      proxy and information statement/prospectus.&#160; For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements, see the section captioned &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in each of Getty Images&#8217; and
      Shutterstock&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.&#160; Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
      assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward looking statements.&#160; While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the proxy and information
      statement/prospectus will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.&#160; Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of
      forward looking statements.&#160; Neither Getty Images nor Shutterstock assumes, and each hereby disclaims, any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.</div>
