into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) with CNB Financial Corporation (&#147;CNB&#148;) and CNB Bank, CNB&#146;s subsidiary bank, pursuant to which CNB will acquire ESSA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each party, ESSA will merge
with and into CNB, with CNB as the surviving entity, and immediately thereafter, ESSA Bank will merge with and into CNB Bank, with CNB Bank as the surviving bank (the &#147;Merger&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of ESSA common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.8547 shares of CNB&#146;s
common stock (the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory
approvals, and approval by the shareholders of ESSA and CNB, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025. CNB and CNB Bank have agreed to appoint Gary S. Olson, Robert C. Selig, Jr. and Daniel J. Henning to their boards of directors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrently with entering into the Merger Agreement, CNB entered into voting agreements with each of the directors and certain executive officers of ESSA in
their capacity as shareholders of ESSA (the &#147;ESSA Voting Agreements&#148;), pursuant to which such shareholders agreed to vote their shares of ESSA common stock in favor of the Merger and ESSA entered into voting agreements with each of the
directors and certain executive officers of CNB in their capacity as shareholders of CNB (the &#147;CNB Voting Agreements&#148;), pursuant to which such shareholders agreed to vote their shares of CNB common stock in favor of issuance of shares of
CNB common stock in the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Merger is not consummated under specified circumstances, ESSA may be required to pay CNB a termination fee of

The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the contract between ESSA and CNB, and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with
negotiating its terms. Moreover, the representations and warranties are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from what may be viewed as material to shareholders, and the representations and warranties may have been
used to allocate risk between ESSA and CNB rather than establishing matters as facts. Each party has also agreed to customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the conduct of ESSA&#146;s and CNB&#146;s businesses during the
period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the transaction; ESSA&#146;s obligation to call a meeting of shareholders to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; CNB&#146;s obligation to
call a meeting of shareholders to approve the issuance of shares of CNB common stock in the Merger; ESSA&#146;s obligation, subject to certain exceptions, to recommend that its shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby; CNB&#146;s obligation to recommend that its shareholders approve the issuance of shares of CNB common stock in the Merger; and ESSA&#146;s <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-solicitation&nbsp;obligations</FONT> relating to
alternative acquisition proposals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ESSA restricted stock awards will automatically vest and be exchanged for the Merger Consideration. ESSA cash settled
awards will automatically vest with any applicable performance-based vesting condition to be deemed achieved at the greater of the target level of performance or actual annualized performance measured as of the most recent completed fiscal quarter
prior to closing, and will be paid in cash. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing is not a complete description of the Merger Agreement, the ESSA Voting Agreements or the CNB

Effective as of the Effective Time of the Merger, the Employment Agreement shall be cancelled in its entirety and the parties thereto shall have no further rights or obligations thereunder. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated or

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>CNB Financial Corporation and ESSA Bancorp, Inc. Announce Strategic Merger </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CLEARFIELD, PA&nbsp;&amp; STROUDSBURG, PA &#151; January&nbsp;10, 2025 (GLOBAL NEWSWIRE) &#151; CNB Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: CCNE) (&#147;CNB&#148;),
parent company of CNB Bank, and ESSA Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: ESSA) (&#147;ESSA&#148;), parent company of ESSA Bank&nbsp;&amp; Trust (&#147;ESSA Bank&#148;), jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which
ESSA will merge with and into CNB, and ESSA Bank will merge with and into CNB Bank. The combined company is expected to have approximately $8&nbsp;billion in total assets, $7&nbsp;billion in total deposits, and $6&nbsp;billion in total loans. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The transaction consideration is all common stock and is presently valued at approximately $214&nbsp;million in the aggregate, or approximately $21.10 per
ESSA share, based upon the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-day</FONT> volume weighted average stock price (VWAP) of $24.69 for CNB common stock as of January&nbsp;8, 2025. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the transaction is expected to
be a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-free</FONT> exchange for shareholders of ESSA for U.S. federal income tax purposes. ESSA shareholders will receive 0.8547 shares of CNB common stock for each outstanding share of ESSA common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Headquartered in Stroudsburg, PA, ESSA operates 20 community offices throughout the Lehigh Valley, Greater Pocono, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and suburban
Philadelphia areas. Following completion of the merger, ESSA Bank&nbsp;&amp; Trust will operate as ESSA Bank, a division of CNB Bank (&#147;ESSA Bank&#148; or &#147;ESSA division&#148;), operating within its existing geographic footprint. CNB
anticipates accelerating growth in the greater Lehigh Valley and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre markets utilizing its commercial-oriented playbook and expanding <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">fee-based</FONT> business lines, bolstering its presence across
Pennsylvania. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the merger agreement, CNB and CNB Bank will each add three directors from ESSA to their respective boards of directors.
Gary S. Olson, current President, CEO, and Director of ESSA, Robert C. Selig Jr., current Chairman of the Board of ESSA, and Daniel J. Henning, ESSA Director, will join both the CNB board and the CNB Bank board following the consummation of the
merger. Additionally, Mr.&nbsp;Olson will have a role as strategic advisor to CNB&#146;s Chief Executive Officer. Also, CNB will form a Board of Advisors for the ESSA Bank division. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We are excited to partner with ESSA which shares such a strong banking tradition with CNB. This combination aligns two high performing banks with an
exceptional commitment to client-focused services for its customers and financial support to sustain the economic vitality of the communities in which they operate,&#148; announced Michael D. Peduzzi, President and CEO of CNB. &#147;There are many
similarities between the markets of ESSA and our existing CNB locations, as well as with our personal approach to banking. We understand the needs of the commercial, retail, and wealth management customers in these markets and look forward to
providing the ESSA division with the support and assistance they need to continue to grow and thrive.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mr.&nbsp;Olson added, &#147;CNB is a powerful
partner for our bank that closely mirrors our culture and values, making the transaction a natural fit. CNB&#146;s multi-state, multi-brand business model fosters our entrepreneurial spirit, and continues our commitment and presence in eastern
Pennsylvania. Leveraging CNB&#146;s infrastructure and robust capital position, suite of banking products, and combined larger lending limit, will further enhance our community banking model, and continue to serve our new and existing customers
extremely well.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Strategic Transaction Highlights: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>
