2025, SunLink Health Systems, Inc., a Georgia corporation (&#147;SunLink&#148;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) with Regional Health Properties, Inc., a Georgia corporation (&#147;Regional&#148;). The

the effective time of the Merger (the &#147;Effective Time&#148;), each five shares of common stock, no par value per share, of SunLink (&#147;SunLink Common Stock&#148;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) will be converted into the right to receive (i)&nbsp;one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share (&#147;Regional Common Stock&#148;), of
Regional (the &#147;Regional Common Stock Consideration&#148;), and (ii)&nbsp;subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Regional Series D Preferred
Stock (as defined below) (the &#147;Regional Preferred Stock Consideration&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger Agreement provides that, effective as of the Effective
Time, each SunLink Equity Award (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that is then outstanding and unexercised shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a SunLink Equity Award with
respect to SunLink Common Stock and shall thereafter automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the Effective Time, Regional&#146;s board of directors shall consist of six directors, of whom (i)&nbsp;two directors shall be designated by Regional,

immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, Brent S. Morrison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Regional, will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company, and Robert M. Thornton, President and

prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or imposing, individually or in the aggregate, a burdensome condition, (d)&nbsp;the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-4</FONT> (the &#147;Registration
