the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of

not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the
Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5 that the
Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person
shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless: (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the
contrary; (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii)&nbsp;the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv)&nbsp;the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified
Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding
or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be

Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any

indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i)&nbsp;in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor from the offering of the New Notes and the Exchange Notes, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving New Notes or Exchange Notes registered under the Securities Act, on the other

Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor or by the Holders and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. </P>

were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d)&nbsp;above. The
amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d)&nbsp;above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section&nbsp;5, in no event shall a Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by which the total price at which the New Notes or Exchange Notes sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The Holders&#146; obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5 are several and not joint. </P>
