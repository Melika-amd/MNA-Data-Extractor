and each Controlling Person from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense, as incurred, arising out of or based
upon the QIU&rsquo;s acting as a &ldquo;qualified independent underwriter&rdquo; (within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Rules of FINRA)
in connection with the Offering, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified person for any legal or other expense reasonably incurred
by them in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense
or action; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability
or expense results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the QIU. Notwithstanding the indemnification set forth in this <u>Section

In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in the foregoing paragraphs
of Section 5.1 is applicable in accordance with its terms but for any reason is held to be unavailable or insufficient from the Company
or the Underwriters, the Company and the Underwriters will contribute to the total losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including
any investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action,
suit or proceeding or any claim asserted) to which any indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as shall be appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand. The relative benefits received
by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds
from the sale of the Public Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total compensation received by the
Underwriters (before deducting expenses) from the sale of Public Shares on behalf of the Company. If, but only if, the allocation provided
by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one
hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, with respect to the statements or omission that resulted in such loss, claim, liability,
expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations with respect to such offering.
Such relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the
intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this <u>Section 5.2</u> were
to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations
referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or
action in respect thereof, referred to above in this <u>Section 5.2</u> shall be deemed to include, for the purpose of this <u>Section
5.2</u>, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim to the extent consistent with <u>Section 5.1.3</u>. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of <u>Section 5.1</u> and
this <u>Section 5.2</u>, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the commissions actually received
by it under this Agreement and no person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities
Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this <u>Section
5.2</u>, any person who controls a party to this Agreement within the meaning of the Securities Act, any affiliates of the respective
Underwriters and any officers, directors, partners, employees or agents of the Underwriters or their respective affiliates, will have
the same rights to contribution as that party, and each director of the Company and each officer of the Company who signed the Registration
Statement will have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the provisions hereof. Any party entitled
to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution
may be made under this <u>Section 5.2</u>, will notify any such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission
to so notify will not relieve that party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have
under this <u>Section 5.2</u> except to the extent that the failure to so notify such other party materially prejudiced the substantive
rights or defenses of the party from whom contribution is sought. Except for a settlement entered into pursuant to the last sentence of
<u>Section 5.1.3</u>, no party will be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent
if such consent is required pursuant to <u>Section 5.1.3</u>.</p>

Indemnified Person of notice of any complaint or the assertion or institution of any Claim with respect to which indemnification is being
sought hereunder, such Indemnified Person shall notify the Company in writing of such complaint or of such assertion or institution but
failure to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any obligation it may have hereunder, except and only to the extent
such failure results in the forfeiture by the Company of substantial rights and defenses. If the Company so elects or is requested by
such Indemnified Person, the Company will assume the defense of such Claim, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such Indemnified Person and the payment of the fees and expenses of such counsel. In the event, however, that legal counsel to such
Indemnified Person reasonably determines that having common counsel would present such counsel with a conflict of interest or if the defendant
in, or target of, any such Claim, includes an Indemnified Person and the Company, and legal counsel to such Indemnified Person reasonably
concludes that there may be legal defenses available to it or other Indemnified Persons different from or in addition to those available
to the Company, then such Indemnified Person may employ its own separate counsel to represent or defend him, her or it in any such Claim
and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company
fails timely or diligently to defend, contest, or otherwise protect against any Claim, the relevant Indemnified Party shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to defend, contest, compromise, settle, assert crossclaims, or counterclaims or otherwise protect against the
same, and shall be fully indemnified by the Company therefor, including without limitation, for the reasonable fees and expenses of its
counsel and all amounts paid as a result of such Claim or the compromise or settlement thereof.</P>

is an Indemnified Person), the Company and the Advisor shall contribute to the Claim for which such indemnity is held unavailable in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits to the Company, on the one hand, and the Advisor on the other, in connection
with the Advisor&rsquo;s engagement referred to above, subject to the limitation that in no event shall the amount of the Advisor&rsquo;s
contribution to such Claim exceed the amount of Fees actually received by the Advisor from the Company pursuant to such engagement. The
Company hereby agrees that the relative benefits to the Company, on the one hand, and the Advisor on the other, with respect to the Advisor&rsquo;s
engagement shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (a) the total value paid or proposed to be paid or received by the Company
or its shareholders as the case may be, pursuant to the transaction (whether or not consummated) for which the Advisor is engaged to render
services bears to (b) the Fee paid or proposed to be paid to the Advisor in connection with such engagement.</P>

by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;<B><I>Commission</I></B>&rdquo;) and the Company has applied

and the Underwriters to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and to proceed with the Public Offering and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each of Cantor EP Holdings I, LLC (the &ldquo;<B><I>Sponsor</I></B>&rdquo;)
and the undersigned individuals, each of whom is a member of the Company&rsquo;s board of directors (the &ldquo;<B><I>Board</I></B>&rdquo;)

Sponsor and each Insider agrees that if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination, then in connection
with such proposed Business Combination, it, he or she shall (a) vote any Ordinary Shares (as defined below) owned by it, him or her in
favor of any proposed Business Combination (except that any public shares that an Insider may purchase in compliance with the requirements
of Rule 14e-5 under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &ldquo;<B><I>Exchange Act</I></B>&rdquo;) would not be voted in favor
of approving the business combination transaction) and (b) not redeem any Ordinary Shares owned by it, him or her in connection with such
shareholder approval (or sell any Ordinary Shares in a tender offer undertaken in connection with a proposed Business Combination).</P>

from the closing of the Public Offering, or (i) such earlier period approved by the Board or (ii) such later period approved by the Company&rsquo;s
shareholders (the &ldquo;<B><I>Completion Window</I></B>&rdquo;), each in accordance with the Company&rsquo;s amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association (as it may be amended from time to time, the &ldquo;<B><I>Articles</I></B>&rdquo;), the Sponsor and each Insider
shall take all reasonable steps to cause the Company to (a) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (b) as promptly
as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the
Class A Ordinary Shares sold in the Public Offering (the &ldquo;<B><I>Offering Shares</I></B>&rdquo;), at a per-share price, payable in
cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account
(net of taxes), divided by the number of then outstanding Offering Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish all Public Shareholders&rsquo;
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (c)
as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company&rsquo;s remaining shareholders and
the Company&rsquo;s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company&rsquo;s obligations under Cayman Islands
law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. The Sponsor and each Insider agrees to not propose any
amendment to the Articles (i) to modify the substance or delay the timing of the Company&rsquo;s obligation to allow redemption in connection
with the Company&rsquo;s initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the Offering Shares if the Company does not complete a Business
Combination within the Completion Window or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders&rsquo; rights or pre-business
combination activity, unless the Company provides its public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Offering Shares upon approval
of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including
interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of taxes), divided by the number of then outstanding Offering Shares.</P>

restrictions set forth in this paragraph 3 or paragraph 6 below, the Company shall promptly announce the impending release or waiver by
press release through a major news service at least two business days before the effective date of the release or waiver. Any release
or waiver granted shall only be effective two business days after the publication date of such press release. The provisions of this paragraph
will not apply if the release or waiver is effected solely to permit a transfer not for consideration and the transferee has agreed in
writing to be bound by the same terms described in this Letter Agreement to the extent and for the duration that such terms remain in
effect at the time of the transfer. If a discretionary waiver, release or termination of any of the Founder Share restrictions (each,

held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per Offering Share is then held

claims by a third party or a Target which executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or
not such waiver is enforceable) and (iii) shall not apply to any claims under the Company&rsquo;s indemnity of the Underwriters against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or by the Company&rsquo;s auditor. The Indemnitor
shall have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Company if, within 30
days following written receipt of notice of the claim to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor notifies the Company in writing that it shall
undertake such defense.</P>

party in connection with the defense. The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the

by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded
(based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or

the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the

within the meaning of the Securities Act. The Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and, if in the future Subscriber
decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Shares, such Shares may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred
only (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act, (ii) pursuant to an exemption from registration
under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, if available, or (iii) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, and in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subscriber acknowledges and understands the Shares are subject to transfer restrictions as described in
<U>Section 8</U>. Subscriber agrees that if any transfer of the Shares or any interest therein is proposed to be made, as a condition
precedent to any such transfer, Subscriber may be required to deliver to the Company an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company
with respect to such transfer. Absent registration or another available exemption from registration, Subscriber agrees it will not resell
the Shares unless otherwise permitted pursuant to the Insider Letter, as described in the Registration Statement. Subscriber further acknowledges
that because the Company is a shell company, Rule 144 may not be available to Subscriber for the resale of the Shares until the one-year
anniversary following consummation of the Business Combination of the Company, despite technical compliance with the requirements of Rule
144 and the release or waiver of any contractual transfer restrictions.</P>
