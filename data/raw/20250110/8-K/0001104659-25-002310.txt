<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Statements included in this Current Report which are not historical
in nature or do not relate to current facts are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, forward-looking statements for purposes
of the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.&#8239; Forward-looking statements are based on, among other things, projections as to the anticipated benefits of the
Merger as well as statements regarding the impact of the Merger on Quanterix&#8217;s and Akoya&#8217;s business and future financial and
operating results, the amount and timing of synergies from the Merger and the closing date for the Merger. Words and phrases such as &#8220;may,&#8221;
&#8220;approximately,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221;

and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.&#8239; Quanterix and Akoya
caution readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict with regard
to, among other things, timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence, which could cause actual results to differ materially from
anticipated results. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the following possibilities: the occurrence of any event, change
or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the definitive merger agreement entered
into between Quanterix and Akoya; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Quanterix or Akoya; the failure
to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely
affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the Merger) and stockholder approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions
to the Merger on a timely basis or at all; the possibility that the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger are not realized
when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as
a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where Quanterix and Akoya do business; the possibility that
the Merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated; diversion of management&#8217;s attention from ongoing business operations
and opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement
or completion of the Merger; changes in Quanterix&#8217;s share price before the closing of the Merger; risks relating to the potential
dilutive effect of shares of Quanterix common stock to be issued in the Merger; and other factors that may affect future results of Quanterix,
Akoya and the combined company.&#8239; Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can
be found in Quanterix&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended, Akoya&#8217;s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other documents Quanterix and Akoya file with the SEC, which are available on
the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov.&#8239;&#8239;&#160;</p>

Current Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to herein. If one or more
events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Quanterix&#8217;s or Akoya&#8217;s underlying assumptions prove

to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information

of each insurer for any non-U.S. Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the benefits determined on an ongoing basis (actual or contingent) with
respect to all current or former participants under such Non-U.S. Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuation most recently
used to determine employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Plan, and none of the contemplated transactions will cause such assets, insurance

and has been maintained in all material respects in good standing with each applicable Governmental Body. No Parent Plan that is a Non-U.S.

</FONT><U>Registration Statement and Proxy Statement for Stockholder Approval</U>. As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution
of this Agreement, (a)&nbsp;Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare a joint proxy statement (the &ldquo;<U>Joint Proxy Statement</U>&rdquo;)
in preliminary form, which shall contain each of the Parent Recommendation and Company Recommendation (unless, in either case, a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, has occurred in accordance with this Agreement),
and (b)&nbsp;Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC (i)&nbsp;a registration statement on Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement
shall be included and (ii)&nbsp;a prospectus relating to the Parent Shares to be offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
(such registration statement together with the amendments and supplements thereto, the &ldquo;<U>Registration Statement</U>&rdquo;). Each
of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. In furtherance thereof, Parent and the Company will work together in
good faith (including by providing reasonable access to relevant data, schedules and work papers), to prepare financial statements, financial
information and such other information as required to be included in the Registration Statement. The Company shall provide, and cause
its Representatives to provide, Parent and its Representatives, with all true, correct and complete information regarding the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that is required by Law to be included in the Registration Statement or reasonably requested by Parent to be
included in the Registration Statement. Each of Parent and the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
independent accounting firms to deliver consent letters regarding the inclusion of their opinions with respect to the Company&rsquo;s
or Parent&rsquo;s, as applicable, financial statements that are included in the Registration Statement, which such consent letter shall
be customary in scope and substance for consent letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
similar to the Registration Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to disseminate
the Joint Proxy Statement to its respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws and other applicable Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares pursuant to this Agreement, and each party
shall furnish all information concerning the Company, Parent and the holders of capital stock of the Company and Parent, as applicable,
as may be reasonably requested by another party in connection with any such action or the preparation, filing or distribution of the Joint
Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or material correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the
Registration Statement shall be made by Parent, or with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, shall be made by the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that this obligation shall not apply with respect to (i) documents filed by a party that are incorporated by reference
in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement or (ii) information relating to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with this Agreement. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. Each of Parent and the Company shall advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any request by the SEC for the amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC, after the other party has had a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to either Parent Stockholders or Company Stockholders,
as applicable.</P>

strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where Quanterix and Akoya do business; the possibility that the proposed
